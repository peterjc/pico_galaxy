# This is a special configuration file to run tests on Travis-CI via
# GitHub notifications when changes are committed.

# See http://travis-ci.org/ for details


# We need Python 2.6 or 2.7 to run Galaxy (and some of the wrappers)
# but don't really care which. We also need Java to run some tools,
# and perhaps the simplest way to get that installed to to run this
# entire TravisCI build as "java" (which will still have a system
# python installed).
#
language: java

# Installing Galaxy
# =================
#
# Before installing our Galaxy wrappers, we need to install Galaxy.
# That may mean using hg to clone it from BitBucket, but too slow?
#
# $ time hg clone https://bitbucket.org/galaxy/galaxy-dist
# ...
# 3m14s
#
# Could use wget to just grab the a specific branch/revision?
#
# $ time wget https://bitbucket.org/galaxy/galaxy-dist/get/stable.tar.bz2
# ...
# 1m33s
#
# We can do better using a GitHub mirror, such as John Chilton's
#
# $ time git clone https://github.com/jmchilton/galaxy-central.git
# ...
# 44s
#
# But better yet seems to be a tar-ball from the GitHub mirror,
#
# $ time wget https://github.com/jmchilton/galaxy-central/archive/master.tar.gz
# ...
# 22s
#
# Note it redirects so wget downloads the tar-ball as a file just called master,
# https://codeload.github.com/jmchilton/galaxy-central/tar.gz/master
#
# However, we might want to focus on the stable release branch?
#
#
# Installing Tool Dependencies
# ============================
#
# We grab Galaxy, and will later make configuration changes specifically
# for testing our tools. Otherwise we use the default settings such as
# running with an SQLite database.
#
# We also need to install our tool dependencies, e.g. NCBI BLAST+ binaries,
# which we will do manually rather than via a (local) Galaxy Tool Shed.

# Configuring tools within Galaxy
# ===============================
#
# We setup a minimal tool_conf.xml and/or tool_conf.xml.sample file to
# get Galaxy to just test our tools, rather than via a (local) Galaxy
# Tool Shed.
#
# TODO - GALAXY_TEST_TOOL_CONF environment variable rather than symlink?
#
# We setup our tools under the Galaxy tool folder by using symlinks.
# TODO - Restructure this to auto-update in future when add folders?
#
# We setup our datatypes by adding blast.py to the Galaxy library, and
# adding the insert into lib/galaxy/datatypes/registry.py, and replacing
# the datatypes_conf.xml file.
#
# We setup our sample data in the Galaxy test-data folder by copying them
# (using symlinks might be faster?)
#
# We setup out sample *.loc files in the Galaxy tool-data folder by copying
# them (using symlinks might be faster?)
#
# We then want to use run.sh to setup all the sample files, fetch eggs etc,
# but not actually start running Galaxy. One way to do this is by calling
# "./run.sh --stop-daemon" but must override its error level 1 return value.

# Testing tools in Galaxy
# =======================
#
# Having setup our Galaxy with a minimal tool_conf.xml / tool_conf.xml.sample
# we call run_functional_tests.sh to run just our tests (grouped under a
# common section "travis" in the XML file for this purpose).
#
# ./run_functional_tests.sh -sid Continuous-Integration-Travis
#
# calls:
#
# python ./scripts/functional_tests.py --with-nosehtml --html-report-file run_functional_tests.html -v `python tool_list.py Continuous-Integration-Travis`
#
# That gives an error sadly under Travis,
# functional_tests.py: error: no such option: --with-nosehtml
# And also,
# functional_tests.py: error: no such option: --html-report-file
# Perhaps Galaxy's nose egg isn't being fetched?

script:
 - python ./scripts/functional_tests.py -v `python tool_list.py Continuous-Integration-Travis`
