**What it does**

This tool runs the commands ``samtools idxstats`` and ``samtools depth`` from the
SAMtools toolkit, and parses their output to produce a consise summary of the
coverage information for each reference sequence.

Input is a sorted and indexed BAM file, the output is tabular. The first four
columns match the output from ``samtools idxstats``, the additional columns are
calculated from the ``samtools depth`` output. The final row with a star as the
reference identifier represents unmapped reads, and will have zeros in every
column except columns one and four.

====== =================================================================================
Column Description
------ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     1 Reference sequence identifier
     2 Reference sequence length
     3 Number of mapped reads
     4 Number of placed but unmapped reads (typically unmapped partners of mapped reads)
     5 Minimum coverage (per base of reference)
     6 Maximum coverage (per base of reference)
     7 Mean coverage (given to 2 dp)
     8 Coverage 1st percential (1% of bases have less coverage, 99% have more)
     9 Coverage 5th percentile
    10 Coverage 10th percentile
    11 Coverage 25th percentile (1st quartile)
    12 Coverage 50th percentile (median, 50% of bases have less coverage, 50% have more)
    13 Coverage 75th percentile (3rd quartile)
    14 Coverage 90th percentile
    15 Coverage 95th percentile
    16 Coverage 99th percential (99% of bases have less coverage, 1% have more)

In this example there were 604 contigs, each with one line in the output table,
plus the final row (labelled with an asterisk) representing 950320 unmapped reads.
In this BAM file, the fourth column was otherwise zero.

**Note**. If using this on a mapping BAM file, beware that the coverage counting is
done per base of the reference.  This means if your reference has any extra bases
compared to the reads being mapped, those bases will be skipped by CIGAR D operators
and these "extra" bases can have an extremely low coverage, giving a potentially
misleading ``min_cov`` values. A sliding window coverage may be more appropriate.

**Note**. Up until samtools 1.2, there was an internal hard limit of 8000 for the
pileup routine, meaning the reported coverage from ``samtools depth`` would show
maximum coverage depths *around* 8000. This is now a run time option.
